      What : 
      - Arrange the repeat todos into their "streak bucket" - a chain of todo in the same repeattaskid and status.
      - There are 2 types of bucket created, done and undone. 
      - The latest todo instance (status 0) will get NULL both buckets.
      Why : 
      - Putting consecutive todo instances is the basis of getting streak calculations.
    tests:

          name: "verify_buckets_mutually_exclusive"

            Why : done and wontdo bucket are calculated fields thus needs testing.
            What: test that done and wontdo buckets are mutually exclusive:
            - One will always be null if the other has valid int value.
            - Otherwise, both should be null.

          expression: | 
            {{ isnull('todo_done_habit_bucket_id') }} != {{ isnull('todo_wontdo_habit_bucket_id') }}
          config:
            where: todo_status !='0'

          name: "verify_same_rowcount_as_upstream"
          description: this add streak do not add additional rows thus should have same row as upstream.
